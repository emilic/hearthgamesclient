# Hearth Games Client

The Official Hearth Games Uploader.  This is a Java program that reads Hearthstone log files and uploads them to HearthGames.com

## Usage

Just download the <a href="http://hearthgames.com/downloadclient">Hearth Games Uploader</a> and start it up.  It will find the Hearthstone log files on PC or Mac, as long it they are installed in the default location.

Note: I will add support for manually specifying the locations in the near future.
