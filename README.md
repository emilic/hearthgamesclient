# Hearth Games Client

The Official Hearth Games Uploader.  This is a Java program that reads Hearthstone log files and uploads them to HearthGames.com

## Usage

Just download the <a href="http://hearthgames.com/downloadclient">Hearth Games Uploader</a> and start it up.  It will find the Hearthstone log files on PC or Mac, as long it they are installed in the default location.

Note: I will add support for manually specifying the locations in the near future.

Have questions or have an issue with it?  Please log an issue.


## Interested in porting this to your favorite programming language?

## Plans for the future

I would like to eventually add real time logging so that I can provide live streaming of games online.
